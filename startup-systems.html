<h1><p>Hi! My name is Aaron, and this is my Github Homepage! I am a Cornell Tech Student in the MEng Computer Science program. I just graduated in May with my Bachelors degree from Bard College at Simon's Rock. I am originally from Bethel, NY, where the famous Woodstock Festival occurred! Unsurprisingly, I guess, I love music, and I also am a huge sports nerd! That's the very short version of me! Thanks!</p>
