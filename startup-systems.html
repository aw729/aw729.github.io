<p>Hi! My name is Aaron, and this is my Github Homepage! I am a Cornell Tech Student in the MEng Computer Science program. I just graduated in May with my Bachelors degree from Bard College at Simon's Rock. I am originally from Bethel, NY, where the famous Woodstock Festival occurred! Unsurprisingly, I guess, I love music, and I also am a huge sports nerd! That's the very short version of me! Thanks!</p>

<p2> FYI I could not gain access to Google Analytics via my CMail, so I had to use my personal account. I also wasn't sure if/how to make the analytics visible on the webpage.</p2>
